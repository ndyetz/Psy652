# The problem
Suppose you ﬁnd a study that provides correlations between measures of academic qualiﬁcations (X1=HS GPA, X2 = SAT Math, X3 = SAT EBRW) and two measures of college success (Y1=college GPA, Y2 = GPA in math courses)


The Correlations Among Tests and success measures

```
        X1      X2         X3     Y1      Y2
 X1     1.000   0.448   0.485   0.425    0.555 
 X2     0.448   1.000   0.333   0.283    0.423
 X3     0.485    0.333   1.000  0.266    0.337 
 Y1     0.425    0.283   0.266  1.000    0.111
 Y2     0.555   0.423    0.337  0.111    1.000

```

# Steps to solve the problem
## Step 1: Define the number of X & Y variables
```{r}
# We have 3 x's. Save it into an object called "nx"
nx <- 3

# We have 2 Y Variables. Save it into an object called "ny"
ny <- 2

```

## Step 2: Add in calculations to help R Identify start and end points
```{r}
#First, allow R to identify how many columns in total there are (which is nx + ny):

ntot <- nx + ny

#Then tell R where the Y variables start (nx + 1)
firsty <- nx + 1


```



## Step 3: enter the weights for the criteria and tests
```{r}
# Criterion weight (The weight for the Y variables)
Cweight<-matrix(c(1.0,1.0),ncol=1,byrow=T)

# Test weights (The X variable weights)
Tweight<-matrix(c(1.0,1.0,1.0),ncol=1,byrow=T)

```
We will be using these to calculate weights later 


## Step 4: we create the matrix
```{r}
##make sure the correlation matrix is arranged so the X variables come first##
Cormat<-matrix(c(1.00,.448,.485,.425,.555,
                 .448,1.00,.333,.283,.423,
                 .485,.333,1.00,.266,.337,
                 .425,.283,.266, 1.00,.111,
                 .555,.423,.337,.111,1.00),
               ncol=5,byrow=TRUE)
```

### View the matrix (and its parts)
A bracket after an object is known as "indexing" a variable.
The left side of the comma is rows. The right side of the comma is columns.
```{r}
Rxx<-Cormat[1:nx,1:nx] # Just the X variables

Ryy<-Cormat[firsty:ntot,firsty:ntot] # Just the y variables

Rxy<-Cormat[1:nx,firsty:ntot]

##display the correlation matrix##
Cormat
```
## Step 5: Separate the X & Y variables
### X variables correlated with themselves
```{r}
Rxx # Just the X variables
```


### Y variables correlated with them selves
```{r}
Ryy # Just the y variables

```

### X variables correlated with the Y variables
```{r}
##display Rxy##
Rxy
```

## Step 6: Calculate the multivariate correlation (Equation on slide 17)
```{r}
###create transpose of each of these vectors###
CweightT<-t(Cweight)
TweightT<-t(Tweight)

###calculate the numerator of the equation for the multivariate validity of this composite###
numer<- TweightT %*% Rxy %*% Cweight

###calculate denominator of the equation for the multivariate validity of this composite###
vary<- CweightT %*% Ryy %*% Cweight
varx<- TweightT %*% Rxx %*% Tweight
denom<-sqrt(vary) * sqrt(varx)

###multivariate validity is simply numerator over denominator###
Multval<- numer/denom
```
### View the multivariate correlation
```{r}
Multval
```
