# Load libraries
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(psych)
library(olsrr)
```



# Import data
```{r,message=FALSE}
slp <- read_csv("slp_esteem.csv")
```



# Describe the data
```{r,message=FALSE}
describe(slp)
```


# Hierarchical Regression Practice

## Build Reduced Model A
```{r}
mod_reda <- lm(data = slp, lifesat ~ hygiene)
ols_regress(mod_reda)
```

```{r}
mod_redb <- lm(data = slp, lifesat ~ hygiene + age)
ols_regress(mod_redb)
```


## Build Reduced Model B
```{r}
mod_redc <- lm(data = slp, lifesat ~  hygiene + age + sleep)
ols_regress(mod_redc)
```

## Build Full model
```{r}
mod_full <- lm(data = slp, lifesat ~ age + hygiene + sleep + self_esteem)
ols_regress(mod_full)
```

## Compare Reduced and Full Models

### Statistically compare model fit
```{r}
anova(mod_reda, mod_redb, mod_redc, mod_full)
# list the most reduced model first, followed by the second-most reduced model, followed by the full model
```
