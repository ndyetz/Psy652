# Create matrices
In R, a matrix is a 2 dimensional vector that contains the same TYPE of element (i.e. all numeric or all character)
## Create a 3x3 matrix

Below, I will be creating a a 3x3 matrix. we use matrix(c(), ncol = #, byrow = T) to create matrices

This represents R in multivariate correlations (the original correlation coefficients)
	    Y1     Y2    Y3
X1 	1.00 	0.60 	  0.20	 
X2 	0.67 	1.00 	  0.10
X3 	0.56	0.45    1.00 	
```{r}
cor_matrix <- matrix(c(
  1.00,.60,.20,
  .85,1.00,.10,
  .56,.45,1.00),
  ncol=3,
  byrow=T)

cor_matrix

```


## Create a 1x3 matrix 

Below we will be creating a 1 dimensional matrix (technically a vector) that contains the weights we want to add to our correlation table.

This will represent weights (w) in multivariate correlation
    Y1  Y2  Y3
X1 2.0 1.0 2.0
```{r}
weights <- matrix(c(2.0,1.0, 2.0),ncol=3,byrow=T)
weights
```



# Multiply matrices
## Multiply the 3x3 and 1x3 matrices
This will represent wR in multivariate correlation (the product of the original correlation matrix and the assigned weights)
Please note, order matters in matrix multiplication. Multiply Make sure your 1 dimentsional table is to the left of your 2 dimensional table. 
```{r}
wR_matrix <- weights %*% cor_matrix
wR_matrix


# Calculate by hand
# Column_1 = (2 * 1.0) + (1 * .85) + (2 * .56)
# Colimn_2 = (2 * .60) + (1 * 1.0) + (2 * .45)
# Column_3 = (2 * .20) + (1 * .10) + (2 * 1.0) 




# Note: Order matters in matrix multiplication! The number of columns of the left matrix must be the same as the number of rows of the right matrix. In other words, in matrix multiplication (unlike ordinary multiplication), A %*% B is not the same as B %*% A. If this isn't right you will get the error message "non-conformable arguments."
```

## Transpose the 1x3 matrix
This will represent w' (the transposed weights) in multivariate correlation
```{r}
weights_t <- t(weights)
weights_t
```


## Multiply this new matrix with the transposed 3x1 matrix
This will represent wRw' in multivariate correlation (the product of the original correlation matrix, the weights, and the transposed weights). 
```{r}

cor(wR_matrix)

wR_wprime_matrix <-  wR_matrix %*% weights_t
wR_wprime_matrix
# Again, order matters! To get the sum of all of the elements in the matrix, put the wR_matrix first. 

# Calculate by hand
# Matrix_t = c(2,      1,   2)
#wR Matrix = c(3.97, 3.1, 2.5)

# Answer = (2 *3.97) + (1 * 3.1) + (2 *2.5)

```
