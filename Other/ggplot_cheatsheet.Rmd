# Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide some helpful information on using ggplot(). This document was created by Neil Yetz on 10/08/2020. In this document I talk about the essential concepts regarding the ggplot() function. I then provide standardized code for creating wonderful ggplot() graphs. 


## The Basics of ggplot()

ggplot requires three essential components to run:

-  1.) ***Data***: Provided as your first argument (or using "data =")  
-  2.) An ***aesthetic***: Abbreviated *aes()*, This is where you can "map" your x and/or y variables as well as many other variables.  
-  3.) a ***geom_*** layer: A geom_ layer takes on many forms. For example if you want to create a boxplot, the geom_ layer is "geom_boxplot()". Want to create a histogram? "geom_histogram()". Correlation? "geom_point()". You can add layers by using a "+" sign. 

Below is the most basic ggplot() graph. 
```
ggplot(data, aes(x = variable)) +
  geom_layer()
```


# Popular geom_layers
In this section, I write the most basic syntax for some of the more popular geom_layers that you will likely be utilizing throughout your career. 

## geom_histogram()
geom_histogram is a univariate layer (It only requires an x axis to be mapped in your aes() ).

For example: 


```{r}
ggplot(yourdata, aes(x = variable1)) +
  geom_histogram() 
```


### Special features with geom_histogram()
#### Setting binwidth
You can change the binwidth of a histogram by using the "binwidth =" argument in your geom_histogram layer. For example: 
```{r}
ggplot(yourdata, aes(x = variable1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) 
```

## geom_density()
geom_density is a univariate layer (It only requires an x axis to be mapped in your aes() ).It is very similar to geom_histogram, but the y-axis is a proportion, rather than a count

For example: 

```{r}
ggplot(yourdata, aes(x = variable1)) +
  geom_density() 
```


## geom_boxplot()
geom_boxplot is a univariate layer (It only requires an x or y axis to be mapped in your aes() )

For example: 

```{r}
ggplot(yourdata, aes(x = variable1)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```

geom_boxplot() also allows you to map a single y-axis if you'd like your boxplot to be vertical. For example

```{r}
ggplot(yourdata, aes(y = variable1)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```

## geom_bar()
geom_bar creates a bar plot and is a univariate layer (It only requires an x or y axis to be mapped in your aes() ). Additionally, your x variable need to be categorical. For example:

```{r}

ggplot(yourdata, aes(x = categorical_variable)) +
  geom_bar()

```


geom_bar() also allows you to map a single y-axis if you'd like your barplot to be flipped. For example

```{r}

ggplot(yourdata, aes(y = categorical_variable)) +
  geom_bar()

```




## geom_point()
geom_point creates a scatterplot and is a bivariate layer (It requires an x AND a y axis in the aes() ). Both variable need to be continuous. For example:


```{r}

ggplot(yourData, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2)) +
  geom_point()

```



## geom_smooth()

geom_smooth creates a regression line and is a bivariate layer (It requires an x AND a y axis in the aes() ). Both variable need to be continuous. For example:
```{r}
ggplot(yourData, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2)) +
  geom_smooth()
```


### Special features with geom_smooth()
#### Adding best fit linear line
You can set the best fir linear line using " method = "lm" " 
```{r}
ggplot(yourData, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


## geom point() + geom_smooth()
Often times, it is appropriate to combine our geom_point() and geom_smooth() layer. This overlays a regression line on top of your scatterplot. For example:
```{r}
ggplot(yourData, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

# Other popular layers
In this section, I outline other useful layers beond that of popular geom_layers. 

## facet_wrap()
The facet_wrap() layer allows you to separate graphs out by a categorical variable. To indicate the variable we would like to facet by, we use a "~" within the facet_wrap() layer. 

In general, it looks as so: 
```
facet_wrap(~categorical_variable)
```

For example, when combined with other geom_boxplot:
```{r}
ggplot(yourdata, aes(x = variable1)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~categorical_variable)
```

or with a geom_scatterplot:

```{r}
ggplot(yourdata, aes(x = variable2, y = variable1)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~categorical_variable)
```


## labs()
The labs() layer allows you to add labels to your plot. You can add:

-   A title (title = )
-   A subtitle (subtitle = )
-   An x-axis label (x = )
-   A y-axis label (y = )

For example:
```{r}

ggplot(yourData, aes(x = variable1, y = variable2)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "This is my title", 
       subtitle = "This is my subtitle", 
       x = "x axis name", 
       y = "y-axis name")
```


# Popular aesthetics
Aesthetics have many more features beyond mapping your x and y variables to your geom_ layer. You can also color by variable levels. You can fill by a categorical variable or a continuous variable.  

## fill = 
Use fill = within your aes() in order to color by a variable level.

For example, filling by a categorical variable:

```{r}
ggplot(yourdata, aes(x = categorical_variable, fill = categorical_variable)) +
  geom_bar()
```


## color = 

use "color =" within your aes() function to color your scatterplots by variable

```{r}

ggplot(yourdata, aes(x = variable2, y = variable1, color = categorical_variable)) +
  geom_point() 
```


## shape =
use "shape =" within your aes() function to have adifferent shapes mapped to your scatterplots by variable

```{r}
ggplot(yourdata, aes(x = variable2, y = variable1, shape = categorical_variable)) +
  geom_point() 
```


# Put it together! 

You can Have multiple layers and/or aesthetics into one graph!


```{r}
ggplot(yourdata, aes(x = variable2, y = variable1, color = categorical_variable, shape = categorical_variable)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~categorical_variable) +
  labs(title = "This is your title",
       subtitle = "This is your subtitle",
       x = "This is your x-axis",
       y = "This is your y-axis")
```
